I learned how to use Git to manage workflow.

Project description:
    One-on-one disputes are an innevitable part of life. These disputes arise when deciding who gets the middle seat on the couch, who gets to
pay the resturant bill, etc. But now I have an app that can easily solve any such dispute dispute. Behold, my Mastermind app. Mastermind is a
game that is easy to learn, but hard to master. It is a game of wit and skill, with just enough luck to keep everyone on their toes. A game of
chess would take far too long, and a beginner would stand no change against a master. Rock paper scissors is purely chance, and there's hardly
any fun. Mastermind is brief, skillful, and everyone is on equal ground. Now any one-on-one dispute can be easily and amusingly solved, with the
victor feeling confident that their victory is deserved. As a bonus, Mastermind can even serve to quench a brief boredom.
